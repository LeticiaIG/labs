    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are back with our queries! :wink:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned some super useful query operators, that will helps us to make much better queries to retrieve the data we need. We will continue using the **Crunchbase** database we used on the last exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fork this repo\n",
    "- Clone this repo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upon completion, run the following commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git add .\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"done\"\n",
    "$ git push origin master\n",

    "Since we will be querying our database from Mongo Compass, you will need to copy/paste the `query`, `projection`, `sort`, `skip` and `limit` you entered on Mongo Compass. In the `queries.md` file, you will find the instructions about the queries you need to do, and a field to fill the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is an example\n",
    " - **`query`**: /*You should copy/paste the query in here*/\n",
    " - **`projection`**: /*You should copy/paste the projection in here*/\n",
    " - **`sort`**: /*You should copy/paste the sort in here*/\n",
    " - **`skip`**: /*You should copy/paste the skip in here*/\n",
    " - **`limit`**: /*You should copy/paste the limit in here*/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration 1\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import the database we will be using for the `lab`. We will use the Crunchbase database. Crunchbase is the premier destination for discovering industry trends, investments, and news about hundreds of thousands of companies globally. From startups to Fortune 500s, Crunchbase is recognized as the primary source of company intelligence by millions of users globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database contains more than 18k documents, and each of them has a lot of information about each of the companies. A document looks like the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You will find the `.zip` file of the Database on the **lab** folder.\n",
    "2. Unzip the file\n",
    "3. From the terminal, import the database to Mongo using the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mongoimport --db companies --collection companies --file companies.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Check on Mongo Compass if everything goes ok:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::info >\n",
    "When running the `mongoimport` you should be located in the same folder as the `companies.json` file.\n",

    "### Iteration 2\n",

    "You already know how this goes, so let's start working:\n",
